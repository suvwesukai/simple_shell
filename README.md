# Simple Shell

##
## Description
The shell is  a command-line interface (CLI) program that provides a way for users to interact with an operating system (OS) by executing commands. It acts as a intermediary layer between the user and the operating system, allowing users to input commands and receive output.

For this project, unless specified otherwise, our program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
